My favourite math concept is **Geometry** because it's everywhere in visual art and I like looking at anything visually stunning (eg. Drawings, Motion Graphics, etc)

I play videogames most of the time, but they're not what most people play. I play indie games or casual games mostly. I don't really play the competitive games that most people play nowadays, and when I do get competitive, it's either a rhythm game or Tetris. I also play Hoyo games (+ WuWa) but I don't really like admitting that. Fun fact: That also means the games I play include a lot of math. I used to do music too but lost motivation. I play the keyboard but I'm not good at it.
