# Team git practice

> Collaboratively create and manage a GitHub repository that features each memberâ€™s profile using markdown files. This will encourage team bonding and familiarize them with Git and GitHub in a fun, personal way.

## Task 1: Role assignment

1. Choose a 'Project Manager'. The role is to oversee the project and **merge pull requests**.
2. Choose a 'Lead Editor'. The role is decide the consistency in formatting and style across all profiles (see content creation below).
3. The Project Manager may also appoint 'Reviewers' as PR come in. Everyone will experience reviewing PRs.
4. (Everybody) will be responsible for drafting their own markdown files (see below).

## Task 2: Content creation

Here's the fun bit. Each student gets to create a personal profile using markdown. You may name the file after your username or real name (e.g. `awangsemaun.md`). The profile should include

- A brief bio.
- Your favourite mathematical concept or problem, and why.
- A fun fact about yourself or your hobbies.
- A photo, avatar image, or any photo you find inspiring.
- (Optional) Any other info about yourself.

Note: The Lead Editor is in charge of deciding the formatting and style, so each student will create their profiles in a consistent manner. As a suggestion, the Lead Editor should push a `template.md` to the repo so that everyone has access to the same style file and just make edits off of that.

## Task 3: Branching

**IMPORTANT** Each student MUST create a new branch to work in when editing their markdown profiles. This can be achieved either on the GitHub website, or on your local machines.

- Once you are satisfied with your markdown file, go ahead and create a pull request. 
- Then, the Project Manager will assign a reviewer(s) to go over the edits.
- Once the reviews are satisfactory, the Project Manager will **merge** the PR into the main branch.

## Task 4: Final touch up

Create a `README.md` file that introduces all the group members. Includea a table of contents with links to each profile. This acts as the 'homepage' for your group. Feel free to spruce it up with images, emojis, etc.! This task can be assigned by whomever the Project Manager feels most suitable.

## Additional instructions

- Ensure design consistency and appealing layout for all profiles. Use any of the markdown features listed [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Practice proper file organisation and naming. Perhaps all images go in a single folder, etc.
- While it is possible to do this exercise entirely on the GitHub website, I encourage you to practice using Git on your local machines as well.
- Markdown files can be opened in RStudio or in the text editor of your choice (e.g. Sublime Text, Atom, VSS Code, Notepad, etc.)
